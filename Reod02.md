## A text editor##
is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.


Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

The command for this task is ls. It's short for list. Let's give it a go.

 **pwd** which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them. This makes it easier to remember them.) 
 
 - pwd
Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
- ls
List the contents of a directory.
- cd
Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

- file
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
- ls -a
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

-Everything is a file under Linux
Even directories.
-Linux is an extensionless system
Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
-Linux is case sensitive
Beware of silly typos.


Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell. This tutorial will assume you are using bash as your shell.

If you would like to know which shell you are using you may use a command called echo to display a system variable stating your current shell. **echo** is a command which is used to display messages.

1.Relative path
2.A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
3.Absolute path
4.A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
