web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages:

HTML, CSS, and JAVA Script.
Html ...... <html>
css ....{css}
javascript....()

html starting with the html layer allows you to foucas on the most important thing about your its content.
 being plain html this layer should work on all kinds of devices, be accessible to all users, and load  quite quickly on slow connections.
 
 
 html+ css 
  adding the css  rules in separte file keep rules.
